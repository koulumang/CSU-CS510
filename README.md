### Overview:
Our project aims to provide a simple and effective way to track objects in real-time using OpenCV in Python. With the help of OpenCV, our application can detect and track the movement of objects within a video feed, and highlight the objects for easier visualization. The project is suitable for a wide range of applications, including security, surveillance, and sports analysis.

### Getting Started:
To get started, you will need to have OpenCV and Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.6 or higher, along with the latest version of OpenCV. You can download OpenCV for Python from the official website or install it using pip. Once you have installed OpenCV, you can clone our project repository to your local machine.

### Contributing:
We welcome contributions from developers who are interested in improving the project. You can submit a pull request with your changes, or open an issue if you have any suggestions or bug reports.
