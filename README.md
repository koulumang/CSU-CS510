### Tracking:
This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to track objects in real-time using OpenCV in Python. With the help of OpenCV, our application can detect and track the movement of objects within a video feed, and highlight the objects for easier visualization. The project is suitable for a wide range of applications, including security, surveillance, and sports analysis.

### Template Matching:
This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to match Template objects in the main image using OpenCV in Python.

### Number Detection:
This project aims to find differences in accuracy of classifying MNIST database with a simple Neural Network (Only dense layers) and CNN (dense+ convolution layers)

### ILSVRC:
This project aims to find differences in accuracy of classifying CIFAR-10 database with a CNN and pretrained CNN.

## Contributing:
